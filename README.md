# Identify Customer Segments Arvato

## Project Overview
In this project, I worked with real-life data provided to me by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. I used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then used those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I also assessed and cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.

## Data 

I did not include the data as the terms and conditions prohibits use of the data outside the Udacity course.
